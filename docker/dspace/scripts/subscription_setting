## SAMPLE CRONTAB FOR A PRODUCTION DSPACE
## You obviously may wish to tweak this for your own installation,
## but this should give you an idea of what you likely wish to schedule via cron.
##
## NOTE: You may also need to add additional sysadmin related tasks to your crontab
## (e.g. zipping up old log files, or even removing old logs, etc).
 
#-----------------
# GLOBAL VARIABLES

# Shell to use
SHELL=/bin/sh
 
# Add all major 'bin' directories to path
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
 
# Set JAVA_OPTS with defaults for DSpace Cron Jobs.
# Only provides 512MB of memory by default (which should be enough for most sites).

# Send out subscription e-mails at 02:00 every day
# (This sends an email to any users who have "subscribed" to a Collection, notifying them of newly added content.)
